                <strong>Mead Lucky Brew</strong><br/>
                <em>Scotch, honey, lemon</em><br/>
                One day down at the Moonhammer feast hall, everyone was having a good time until something dreadful happened... they ran out of mead.
                Tordek Cleverbeard, thinking quickly, went behind the bar and came up with this delightful concoction. 
                The next day, Tordek's pickaxe struck gold, and since then he's referred to this drink simply as "mead lucky brew."

                <strong>Dwarven Daiquiri</strong><br/>
                <em>Jamaican rum, lime, amaro di angostura</em><br/>
                The Moonhammer dwarves learned of the daiquiri from other races, but found it to be too tame for their tastes.
                This version of the drink is the preferred dwarven way to make it, using a bolder rum and a healthy dose of spices to give it a real punch.

                <strong>Rune Driver</strong><br/>
                <em>Vodka, orange juice, pineapple juice, bitters</em><br/>
                Dwarven ships use powerful rune magic to navigate their way through Wildspace.
                Just like a dwarven rune drive, this drink is easy to work with and will definitely get you where you're going.
                If you're interested in making things more interesting, try asking for "extra rune magic."

                <strong>Voidfarer Grog</strong><br/>
                <em>Rum, pineapple juice, orange juice, coconut</em><br/>
                People have a lot of reasons to sail with the Voidfarer. 
                Some are in it for the money, some for the camaraderie, and others because they have nowhere else to go.
                But everyone agrees that there is one perk that sets the Voidfarer apart from other ships - the quality of the grog.

            <strong>The Lawful Neutral</strong><br/>
            <em>Gin, tonic, bitters</em><br/>
            Life as a dwarf is a two-sided coin. 
            On one side of the coin, dwarves love to drink, sing, and fight.
            But on the other side, dwarves are known for their devotion to order, hierarchy, and law.
            This drink, with its stark simplicity, pays homage to the lawful side of dwarven culture... but drink enough of them and you'll be partying as hard as anyone.
